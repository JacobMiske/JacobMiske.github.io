A content management system (CMS) is a software application that can be used to manage the creation and
modification of digital content. CMSs are typically used for enterprise content management (ECM) and web content
management (WCM). ECM typically supports multiple users in a collaborative environment[4] by integrating document
management, digital asset management and record retention. Alternatively, WCM is the collaborative authoring for
websites and may include text and embed graphics, photos, video, audio, maps and program code that display content
and interact with the user.[6][7] ECM typically includes a WCM function.
