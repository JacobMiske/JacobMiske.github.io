<h2>Welcome to my Site</h2>
<p>
Hi, my name is Jacob Miske and this site is for sharing information.

I created this site record notes, some of which will later be sharable with others hopefully. Learning is a
  passion and something I like to share. If you have any questions about the content or want to chat, my
  email is at the footer of each page.

A content management system (CMS) is a software application that can be used to manage the creation and
modification of digital content. CMSs are typically used for enterprise content management (ECM) and web content
management (WCM). ECM typically supports multiple users in a collaborative environment by integrating document
management, digital asset management and record retention. Alternatively, WCM is the collaborative authoring for
websites and may include text and embed graphics, photos, video, audio, maps and program code that display content
and interact with the user. ECM typically includes a WCM function.
