The test is administrated by the Educational Testing Service to measure the verbal, quantitative, and analytical writing 
you have developed in the course of one's academic career. High GRE scores correlate with the probability of success in
graduate school.

There will be:

- 1 Analytical writing section composed of two, 30 minute tasks.
- 2 Verbal Ability sections of 20 questions each (30 min each)
- 2 Quantitative Ability sections of 20 questions each (35 min each)

Additionally, there may be 1 unidentified experimental section that functions as a third verbal or quantitative section.

Occasionally, there may be an identified research section (but not if there is an Experimental section)

### Computer-Adaptive Test
The computer GRE assesses the user's performance and adjusts the difficulty of questions between sections. 

### Should I guess?
No penalty for guesses in the modern test.
