Region is a geographical area with at least one datacenter. When a resource is deployed on Azure, the user 
chooses the region where the resource is deployed. Exceptions are some services are only available in some 
regions, such as VM size or storage types. Some global Azure services do not need the user to select a region 
such as the Azure Active Directory, Traffic Manager, or DNS. Over 54 total regions.

Availability Zones

Each AZ is made up of one or more datacenters with independent systems. If one goes down the other can continue to work.
Availability zones are connected by fiber. Region pairs are identical resources running in two datacenters in the same
geography.
