The absorbance of a given sample, $$A$$, is measured in Absorbance Units (AU). $$I_0$$ is the incident intensity and $$I$$ is the transmitted intensity. 

$$
A = \log_{10} (\dfrac{I_0}{I}) = \epsilon c L
$$

$$L$$ is the path length through the sample, $$c$$ is the concentraion of the absorbing species, and for each species and wavelength, ##\epsilon## is known as the molar absorbtivity or extinction coefficient. This constant is a fundamental molecular property in a given solvent, at a particular temperature and pressure, and has units of $$1/M * cm$$.

This law is used extensively in the development and use of spectrophotometers. In these devices, the intensity of the visible light spectrum is measured as a series of data points across incoming wavelengths.
