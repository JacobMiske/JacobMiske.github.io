The collection of vocabulary words I wanted to clarify at some point.

## A

## B

## C

### Contextual image classification
A topic of pattern recognition in computer vision, is an approach of classification based on contextual information in 
images. "Contextual" means this approach is focusing on the relationship of the nearby pixels, which is also called 
the neighbourhood.

### Cryogen
A substance used to produce low temperatures; a freezing mixture. Examples are liquid nitrogen and dry ice.

## D

## E

## F

## G

### Gas Chromatography - Mass Spectroscopy (GCMS)
An analytical method that combines features of GC and MS to identiy different substances within a test sample. From drug detection, fire investigation, env. analysis, etc. 

## H

### Hyperspectral Imaging
Hyperspectral imaging, like other spectral imaging, collects and processes information from across the electromagnetic 
spectrum. The goal of hyperspectral imaging is to obtain the spectrum for each pixel in the image of a scene, with the 
purpose of finding objects, identifying materials, or detecting processes.

## I

## J

## K

## L

## M

### Magnetron
A high-powered vacuum tube that generates microwaves using the interaction of a stream of electrons with a magnetic field while moving past a series of open metal cavities (cavity resonators). Electrons pass by the openings to these cavities and cause microwaves to oscillate within, similar to the way a whistle produces a tone when excited by an air stream blown past its opening.

### Mass Spectroscopy
A mass spectrometer measures the spectrum of the masses of the atoms or molecules present in a gas. It uses a ion 
source and a magnetic field to create and move a positive ion from a neutral molecule.

### Microwave
Microwaves are a form of electromagnetic radiation with wavelengths ranging from about one meter (1m) to one millimeter; 
(1mm) with frequencies between 300 MHz and 300 GHz. Different sources define different frequency ranges as microwaves; 
the above broad definition includes both UHF and EHF bands.

## N

### Nuclear Fission
In nuclear physics and nuclear chemistry, nuclear fission is a nuclear reaction or a radioactive decay process in which
 the nucleus of an atom splits into two or more smaller, lighter nuclei. The fission process often produces gamma 
 photons, and releases a very large amount of energy even by the energetic standards of radioactive decay.
 
### Nuclear Fusion
Nuclear fusion is a reaction in which two or more atomic nuclei are combined to form one or more different atomic nuclei 
and subatomic particles. The difference in mass between the reactants and products is manifested as either the release 
or absorption of energy.

## O

## P

## Q

## R

## S

### Spectral signature
A particular variation of reflectance or emittance of a material with respect to wavelengths. The spectral signature of 
stars indicates the composition of the stellar atmosphere. The spectral signature of an object is a function of the
incidental EM wavelengths and material interactions in the EM spectrum.

### Spectrometry
Use of a scientific instrument used to separate and measure spectral components of a physical phenomenon. Spectrometer 
is a broad term often used to describe instruments that measure a continuous variable of a phenomenon where the spectral 
components are somehow mixed. In visible light a spectrometer can separate white light and measure individual narrow 
bands of color, called a spectrum.

### Spectroscopy
The study of the interaction between matter and electromagnetic radiation. Spectroscopy is a fundamental exploratory 
tool in the fields of physics, chemistry, and astronomy, allowing the composition, physical structure and electronic 
structure of matter to be investigated at atomic scale, molecular scale, macro scale, and over astronomical distances. 
Important applications arise from biomedical spectroscopy in the areas of tissue analysis and medical imaging.

## T

### Taxonomy
The practice and science of classification of things or concepts, including the principles that underlie such 
classification.

## U

## V

## W

## X

## Y

## Z
