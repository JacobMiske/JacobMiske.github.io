### Outline of Nuclear Lecture

- Fission and Fusion
- Uranium resource for fission power. 
- Introduction to nuclear structure, binding energy, decay

#### Fission
High energy density, non-carbon energy source.

Fission of heavy nuclei into more tightly bound nuclei. U-235 is at 0.72% abundance. Rest is U-138.
Uranium can sustain a fission reaction at about 3-4% and add a moderator (water). 

Fission is a natural process. It is easy to start but hard to control. 

It takes about 200 tons of natural uranium to get 26 tons of enriched uranium that goes into a GWe
power reactor. 

#### Fusion
Fusion of light nuclei to more tightly bound medium mass nuclei.

Very common in the universe but only occurred briefly in special systems on Earth.

Fusion experiments on Earth use deuterium and tritium. 


#### Scope of the Uranium Resource
Uranium is not a rare element. Crustral abundance of U is about 2.7 ppm. greater than Mo and much greater than Iodine.

Forms relative to high quality ores. Large deposit of 16.5% by weight is mined in Saskatchewa, Canada. Typically,
economical deposits are mined at 0.1% by weight (400 times the crustral abundance).

##### Redbook Numbers for Uranium
Converting the reasonably assured resources (RAR), there are tens of thousands of years of Uranium to use.

#### Nuclear Properties
Roughly spherical, small 1e-12 cm in radius for nuclei. Roughly 1/10,000 size of an atom.
