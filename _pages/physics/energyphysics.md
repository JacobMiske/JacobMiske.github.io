# Physics of Energy
### by: Jaffe and Taylor

## Chapter 2: Mechanical Energy

### 2.1: Kinetic Energy

$$
\begin{align*}
    E_{kin} = \frac{1}{2} mv^2
\end{align*}
$$

### 2.2: Potential Energy

#### 2.2.1: Forces and Potential Energy

$$
F = m \frac{d^2}{dt^2} x(t) = m \ddot(x)
$$

#### 2.2.2 Work and Power


## Chapter 3: Electromagnetic Energy

Stuff from 8.02.

$$
C = \frac{\epsilon A}{d}
$$

$$
E_{EM} = \frac{1}{2} C V^2
$$

$$
P_{resistance} = \frac{V^2 (t)}{R}
$$

$$
R = \frac{\rho l}{A}
$$

Resistive Losses over a Transmission line:

$$
\frac{P_{lost}}{P_{L}} \approx \frac{R P_L}{V_{RMS}^{2}}
$$

## Chapter 4: Waves and Light

Wave equation:

$$
\frac{\delta^2 f}{\delta t^2} = v^2 \frac{\delta^2 f}{\delta x^2}
$$

## Chapter 5: Thermodynamics I: Heat and Thermal Energy

### 5.1: What is Heat?

#### 5.1.3 Ideal Gases and the Equipartiiton Theorem

For a monoatomic ideal gas we can take <E> as a working definition of temperature.A

$$
<E>  = \frac{3}{2}m \bar{v}^2 = \frac{3}{2} k_B T; k_B = 1.381e23 J/K
$$

Gas constant is a function of Avogadro's number and Boltzmann's constant.

$$
R = N_{avo} k_B
$$

### 5.2: Pressure and Work

#### Example 5.1 Thermal Energy of Argon Gas
At T=300K we have U = 3RT/2 = 3.7 kJ. The thermal energy at 600K is twice
this amount, so the thermal energy difference is about 3.7 kJ.

### 5.3: First Law of Thermodynamics

$$
dU = dQ - dW; dU = dQ - pdV
$$

## Chapter 6: Heat Transfer

Conduction, convection, radiation.

Block Resistance given as R value, for series, for parallel
$$
R = L/k; R_{total} = R_ 1 + R_2 + R_3; \frac{A}{R_{eff}} = \frac{A_1}{R_1} + \frac{A_2}{R_2} + \frac{A_3}{R_3}
$$

Radiative heat transfer.
$$
\frac{dQ}{dt} = \sigma T^4 A
$$

## Chapter 7: Introduction to Quantum Physics


## Chapter 25: Photovoltaic Solar Cells
From 2005 to 2020, PV solar usage has doubled every two years or so. In 2016, worldwide
capacity was about 300 GW, delivered power is about 15% of capacity.


## Chapter 28: Wind, A highly valuable resource
Of 173000 TW solar energy deposited on Earth, 30% is reflected. The remaining 120000 TW turns to thermal energy.
Some of this thermal energy causes differences in temperature and pressure gradients which build to form wind.

In 2015, the US had about 74 GW of wind capacity. China had 145 GW of capacity.

Power Density: wind kinetic energy flux.

$$
P_{wind} = \dfrac{1}{2} \rho v^2 \times v = \dfrac{1}{2} \rho v^3
$$

For max power to a turbine, consider Betz limit

$$
\mathcal{P} \times A = \dfrac{8}{27} (1.17 kg/m^3)(10m/s)^3 (10m^2) \approx 3.5 kW
$$
