### Alternating Current
Current itself describes the opposite direction of electrons along a given material. Often, this material is a conductor like some copper or aluminum wire.

### AC Generation
As a magnetic rotor rotates about a stator, the magnetic field applied to inductors across the motor will alternate. Due to the switching magnetic field, an electric current is driven back and forth. This current alternates at the same frequency as the rotating magnet which drives it. This construct is an AC generator. For each phase, two inductors are added.

### Single Phase AC
Imagine a lamp connected in series to the two coils of a AC generator. As the alternating current switches direction, the lamp would dim momentarily since the overall power dissapated by the lamp's impedence would go to zero watts.
