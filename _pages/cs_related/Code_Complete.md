If you haven't had much formal training, you are in good companies, about 50,000 new developers
event the professional world each year (BLS 2004), but only 35,000 degrees are awarded
each year.

### Key Benefits
- Complete software-construction reference
- Ready-to-use checklists
- State of the art info
- Larger perspective
- Absence of hype
- Concepts applicable to most common languages
- Code examples

### Why was this written?

- Topic of construction neglected
- Construction is important
- No comparable book is written

# Notes

## Chapter 1: Welcome to Software Construction
Construction in software is the planning, designing, and checking of work. Mostly refers to the 
hands on part of creating something.

### 1.1: What is Software Construction?
Distinct set of activities:
- Problem definition
- Requirements development
- Construction planning
- Software architecture, or high level design
- Detailed design
- Coding and debugging
- Unit testing
- Integration Testing
- Integration
- System Testing
- Corrective Maintenance

Need to strike a balance between too much red tape and too little. This book focuses
on the coding and debugging side of the process.

### 1.2: Why is Software Construction Important?
- Construction is a large part of software development
- Construction is the central activity in software development
- With a focus on construction, the individual can improve enormously
- Construction's product, source code, is only accurate description of the software.
- Construction is guaranteed to be done.

### 1.3: How to Read This Book
Book meant to be read either cover to cover or by topic.

Specific programming tips on Chapter 6. 

If not sure where to start, go to 3.2 (determining kind of software).

## Chapter 2: Metaphors for a Richer Understanding of Software Dev.
Heuristics in design. Computer science has some of the most colorful language of any field.


### 2.1: The Importance of Metaphors
Developments arise out of analogies. By comparing the complex to the known, we 
can understand insights of the less-familiar topic. This use of metaphor
is called modeling.

Kinetic theory of gases was based on a "billiard ball" model. Gas molecules were thought to have 
mass and to collide elastically, as billiard balls do, and many useful theorems were developed from 
this model.

Wave theory of light was also developed from exploring similarities between light and sound.

In the 1973 Turing Award lecture, Charles Bachman described the change from the earth centered universe 
to the sun centered universe and compared it to the computer-centered data structure world to the database 
centered structured world.
