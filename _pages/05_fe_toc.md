The fundamentals of engineering (FE) exam is held by the
National Council of Examiners for Engineering and Surveying to evaluate engineers and provide certification.

The exam is a computer based test. It is closed book with an electronic reference. Examinees have 6 hrs to complete 110 questions.

There are 14 sections to the exam.

The mathematics section goes over analyic geometry, calculus, ordinary diff. equs., linear algebra, numerical methods, algorithm and logic.

The probability and statistics section goes over probability distributions, measures of central tendency, expected value, regression, curve fitting, and goodness of fit.

The ethics and professional practice section goes over codes of ethics, public health, intellectual property, and societal considerations.

The engineering economics section goes over the time value of money, cost types, breakdowns, and economic analyses.

The electricity and magnetism section goes over electrical fundamentals, DC circuit analysis, AC circuit analysis, and motors.

The statics section goes over resultant forces, concurrent forces, equilibrium, frames/trusses, centroids, moments, static friction.
