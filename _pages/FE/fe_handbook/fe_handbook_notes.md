### Springs

#### Mechanical Springs
Helical linear springs: shear stress in helical, linear spring:

$$ \tau = K_s \dfrac{8 F D}{\pi d^3} $$

d is wire diameter, F is force, D is spring diameter, K = (2C+1)/(2C), C = D/d

#### Equivalent Spring Constant
Springs in series:

$$ \dfrac{1}{k_{eq}} = \sum_i \dfrac{1}{k_i} $$

Springs in parallel:

$$ k_{eq} = \sum_i k_i $$

Spring material: minimum tensile strength of common steels

$$ S_{ut} = A/d^m $$

### Bearings

#### Ball Bearing Selection
Minimum basic load rating:

$$ C = P L^{1/a} $$

C = basic load rating, P = design radial load, L = millions of revs design life, a=3 for ball, a=10/3 for roller
