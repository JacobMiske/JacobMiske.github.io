### Thermal Stress

If an object changes temperature, the object experiences length, area, and volume changes. 
The thermal expansion efficient $$\alpha$$ determines this change.

$$ \delta_{th} = \alpha L (t - t_0) $$

Dividing by the original length, we can determine the thermal strain.

$$ \epsilon_{th} = \dfrac{\delta_{th}}{L} = \alpha (t - t_0) $$

The thermal stress and thermal strain is related by Hooke's law.

$$ \sigma_{th} = E \epsilon_{th} $$

### Thin Walled Tanks

Tanks under internal pressure experience circumferential, longitudinal, and radial stresses. 
If the wall thickness (t) is small, the radial stress is negligible.

$$\dfrac{t}{R_i} < 0.1 \text{ (thin walled)}$$
