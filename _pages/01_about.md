This website is a content management system using the Jekyll framework.

It is primarily used by Jacob Miske to record and share notes with others.

### Purpose
* Manage my notes
* Provide an education resource
* Share knowledge with others
* Learn more of the Ruby language and Jekyll framework in the process

### The Internet and Me

Creating this CMS site and the content reminds me of keeping track of own's presence in the world.

In particular, that presence on the internet.
