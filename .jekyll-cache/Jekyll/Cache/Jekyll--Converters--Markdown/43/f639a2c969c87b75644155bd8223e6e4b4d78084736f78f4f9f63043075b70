<h2 id="chapter-1-welcome-to-software-construction">Chapter 1: Welcome to Software Construction</h2>
<p>Construction in software is the planning, designing, and checking of work. Mostly refers to the 
hands on part of creating something.</p>

<h3 id="11-what-is-software-construction">1.1: What is Software Construction?</h3>
<p>Distinct set of activities:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Problem definition</li>
  <li>Requirements development</li>
  <li>Construction planning</li>
  <li>Software architecture, or high level design</li>
  <li>Detailed design</li>
  <li>Coding and debugging</li>
  <li>Unit testing</li>
  <li>Integration Testing</li>
  <li>Integration</li>
  <li>System Testing</li>
  <li>Corrective Maintenance</li>
</ul>

<p>Need to strike a balance between too much red tape and too little. This book focuses
on the coding and debugging side of the process.</p>

<h3 id="12-why-is-software-construction-important">1.2: Why is Software Construction Important?</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Construction is a large part of software development</li>
  <li>Construction is the central activity in software development</li>
  <li>With a focus on construction, the individual can improve enormously</li>
  <li>Construction‚Äôs product, source code, is only accurate description of the software.</li>
  <li>Construction is guaranteed to be done.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="13-how-to-read-this-book">1.3: How to Read This Book</h3>
<p>Book meant to be read either cover to cover or by topic.</p>

<p>Specific programming tips on Chapter 6.</p>

<p>If not sure where to start, go to 3.2 (determining kind of software).</p>

<h2 id="chapter-2-metaphors-for-a-richer-understanding-of-software-dev">Chapter 2: Metaphors for a Richer Understanding of Software Dev.</h2>
<p>Heuristics in design. Computer science has some of the most colorful language of any field.</p>

<h3 id="21-the-importance-of-metaphors">2.1: The Importance of Metaphors</h3>
<p>Developments arise out of analogies. By comparing the complex to the known, we 
can understand insights of the less-familiar topic. This use of metaphor
is called modeling.</p>

<p>Kinetic theory of gases was based on a ‚Äúbilliard ball‚Äù model. Gas molecules were thought to have 
mass and to collide elastically, as billiard balls do, and many useful theorems were developed from 
this model.</p>

<p>Wave theory of light was also developed from exploring similarities between light and sound.</p>

<p>In the 1973 Turing Award lecture, Charles Bachman described the change from the earth centered universe 
to the sun centered universe and compared it to the computer-centered data structure world to the database 
centered structured world.</p>

<h3 id="22-how-to-use-metaphors">2.2: How to Use Metaphors</h3>
<p>Algorithm is a set of well-defined instructions for carrying out a task. An algorithm is predictable, (often) 
deterministic, and not subject to change (well not including probabilistic algorithms).</p>

<p>Having directions that told you exactly how to solve each problem would make programming easier and more predictable.
However, the science is not that advanced yet. Conceptualizing the problem is often the most challenging part. Since
each problem is unique.</p>
