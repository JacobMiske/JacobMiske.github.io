<h3 id="mass-spectroscopy">Mass Spectroscopy</h3>
<p>A mass spectrometer measures the spectrum of the masses of the atoms or molecules present in a gas. It uses a ion 
source and a magnetic field to create and move a positive ion from a neutral molecule.</p>

<h3 id="microwave">Microwave</h3>
<p>Microwaves are a form of electromagnetic radiation with wavelengths ranging from about one meter (1m) to one millimeter; 
(1mm) with frequencies between 300 MHz and 300 GHz. Different sources define different frequency ranges as microwaves; 
the above broad definition includes both UHF and EHF bands.</p>

<h3 id="spectrometry">Spectrometry</h3>
<p>Use of a scientific instrument used to separate and measure spectral components of a physical phenomenon. Spectrometer 
is a broad term often used to describe instruments that measure a continuous variable of a phenomenon where the spectral 
components are somehow mixed. In visible light a spectrometer can separate white light and measure individual narrow 
bands of color, called a spectrum.</p>

<h3 id="spectroscopy">Spectroscopy</h3>
<p>The study of the interaction between matter and electromagnetic radiation. Spectroscopy is a fundamental exploratory 
tool in the fields of physics, chemistry, and astronomy, allowing the composition, physical structure and electronic 
structure of matter to be investigated at atomic scale, molecular scale, macro scale, and over astronomical distances. 
Important applications arise from biomedical spectroscopy in the areas of tissue analysis and medical imaging.</p>
