I"‘<p>My JacobMiske.github.io page was originally a class project from 22.033 where I built
a neutron detector device using Li-6.</p>

<p>My GitHub Pages website will now serve as a Jekyll site that explains my progress
on personnel projects. Basically a blog for thoughts about my GitHub related work.</p>

<p>My personnel blog will still be jacobmiske.com. This is hosted on Google Domains
using the Blogger template website.</p>

<p>I have jacobmiske.net under AWSâ€™s route 53 as a statically hosted website. This site
will end up using some other technology for this site. I will try to avoid using React
or Jekyll so I force myself to mix things up.</p>
