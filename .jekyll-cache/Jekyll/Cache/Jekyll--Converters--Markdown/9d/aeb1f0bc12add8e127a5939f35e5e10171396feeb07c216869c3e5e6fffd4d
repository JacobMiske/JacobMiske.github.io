<h4 id="fission">Fission</h4>
<p>High energy density, non-carbon energy source.</p>

<p>Fission of heavy nuclei into more tightly bound nuclei. U-235 is at 0.72% abundance. Rest is U-138.
Uranium can sustain a fission reaction at about 3-4% and add a moderator (water).</p>

<p>Fission is a natural process. It is easy to start but hard to control.</p>

<p>It takes about 200 tons of natural uranium to get 26 tons of enriched uranium that goes into a GWe
power reactor.</p>

<h4 id="fusion">Fusion</h4>
<p>Fusion of light nuclei to more tightly bound medium mass nuclei.</p>

<p>Very common in the universe but only occurred briefly in special systems on Earth.</p>

<p>Fusion experiments on Earth use deuterium and tritium.</p>

<h4 id="scope-of-the-uranium-resource">Scope of the Uranium Resource</h4>
<p>Uranium is not a rare element. Crustral abundance of U is about 2.7 ppm. greater than Mo and much greater than Iodine.</p>

<p>Forms relative to high quality ores. Large deposit of 16.5% by weight is mined in Saskatchewa, Canada. Typically,
economical deposits are mined at 0.1% by weight (400 times the crustral abundance).</p>

<h5 id="redbook-numbers-for-uranium">Redbook Numbers for Uranium</h5>
<p>Converting the reasonably assured resources (RAR), there are tens of thousands of years of Uranium to use.</p>

<h4 id="nuclear-properties">Nuclear Properties</h4>
<p>Roughly spherical, small 1e-12 cm in radius for nuclei. Roughly 1/10,000 size of an atom.</p>
