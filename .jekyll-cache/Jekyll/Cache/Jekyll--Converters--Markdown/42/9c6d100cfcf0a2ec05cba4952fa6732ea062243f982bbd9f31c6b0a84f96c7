<p>EBS volume types: SSD and HDD</p>

<p>SSH has a higher IOPS performance. More costly.</p>

<p>High performing arch offloads static content to S3. Dramatically improves web server performance.</p>

<p>In S3, the name is specific to the region. They are globally unique however. The path after the bucket name is the key.</p>

<p>Pay for GBs per month, transfer out of region, and PUT/COPY/POST/etc.</p>

<p>There are two S3 storage classes. Standard and Infrequent-Access.</p>

<p>Lifecycle policies can automatically move S3 data from standard to IA to glacierâ€¦ and eventually delete.</p>

<h5 id="databases">Databases</h5>
<p>Amazon RDS:</p>

<p>Managed relational database. Complex transactions or complex queries. medium to high write rate. High durability.</p>

<p>Amazon no-sql on Dynamo DB:</p>

<p>Good for massive read/write and sharding. Scales horizontally fast. Read capacity is up to 4kB. Write cap is up to 1kB.
One strongly consistent read/s. Two eventually consistent reads per second. One write per second.</p>

<p>Data warehouse with redshift, sql interface. Getting aggregate numbers on tables.</p>
