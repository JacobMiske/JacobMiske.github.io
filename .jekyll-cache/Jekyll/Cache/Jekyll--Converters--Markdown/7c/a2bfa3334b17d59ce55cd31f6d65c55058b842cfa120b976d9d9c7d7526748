I";<p>The absorbance of a given sample, \(A\), is measured in Absorbance Units (AU). \(I_0\) is the incident intensity and \(I\) is the transmitted intensity.</p>

\[A = \log_{10} (\dfrac{I_0}{I}) = \epsilon c L\]

<p>\(L\) is the path length through the sample, \(c\) is the concentraion of the absorbing species, and for each species and wavelength, ##\epsilon## is known as the molar absorbtivity or extinction coefficient. This constant is a fundamental molecular property in a given solvent, at a particular temperature and pressure, and has units of \(1/M * cm\).</p>
