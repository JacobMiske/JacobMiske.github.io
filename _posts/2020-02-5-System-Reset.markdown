At my internship in Cambridgeport at Shell Techworks, I have been learning a lot about software version control
and system architectures. While the target of most of this learning has been to reinforce my understanding of
digital systems, these subjects have a wide applicability in larger, physical systems as well. In programming, 
the sense of 'object-oriented programming' can also have interesting perspectives on how we organize other
elements of our own lives. 

Now, given all those wide, high-level statements, I would like to reflect on a recent system reset I engaged in.
My coworkers and I were informed that we would be upgrading our STW provided MacBooks from the Mac OS version 'Mojave'
to the new 'Catalina' version. This process would be coupled with a system level 'image' of the new OS which apparently
has restricted my coworkers ability to make system admin level changes on their own machines. As it turned out, I did
not have to update my machine and I have retained my admin privileges because I am working on a Shell TechWorks level 
MacBook. 

In addition to this change which pushed me to make backups of my existing home/ drives, I decided to factory reset my 
three main computers to their blank slates. This is so I can increase their performance by removing old, unnecessary 
files and applications easily. And after the reset, I uploaded my backup files that I wanted to keep working towards.

Here's to a cleaner computer usage experiment. :)
